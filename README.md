### Project Overview

This project is designed for learning purposes, focusing on exploring various aspects of web development with Next.js. Throughout this project, I have gained practical experience in:

- Handling Next.js routing from middleware
- Implementing protected routes with authentication
- Managing authentication mechanisms such as OAuth, credential management, and role-based access control
- Ensuring seamless authentication between server and client
- Implementing two-factor authentication (F2A) and email verification processes
